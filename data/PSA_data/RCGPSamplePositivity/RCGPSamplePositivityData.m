%Purpose:
%Construct arrays storing weekly Influenza positivity values 
%monitored through the RCGP sentinel swabbing scheme in England
%Save to text/MAT files

%Method:
%Values obtained from Public Health England weekly & annual national influenza reports

%RCGP sentinel swabbing
%Data from these schemes are used to calculate the proportion of ILI cases consulting
%in primary care who are swabbed and who are positive for influenza each week.

%Subset of general practices in the RCGP Weekly Returns Service
%submits respiratory samples for virological testing from patients presenting in primary
%care with an ILI.
